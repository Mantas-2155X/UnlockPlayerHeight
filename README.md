It is *recommended*, that you keep players height during H at 75 (default) to avoid issues with H animations. 
Illusion lazy-ed out and made all H animations prefer 75 as the player height, causing some of them to look weird when the player is at different heights.  

Needs https://github.com/IllusionMods/BepisPlugins for configuration to work!

**Current Features:**  
* Studio support  
* Align camera position with players height (AIS)  
* Set player height according to card (seperate for Roam and H (AIS))  
* Set player height according to custom value (seperate for Roam and H (AIS))  
* Male height slider is now available in the charamaker

**Download:**  
* Download the latest `GAME_UnlockPlayerHeight.zip` from https://github.com/Mantas-2155X/UnlockPlayerHeight/releases  

**Installation:**  
* Unzip `GAME_UnlockPlayerHeight.zip` into your game directory. If done correctly, in `BepInEx/plugins/2155X/` you should see `GAME_UnlockPlayerHeight.dll`
